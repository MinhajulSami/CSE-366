Objective:
Familiarize students with file I/O, list manipulation, and basic iteration in Python.

Instructions: 
1. Read the student IDs from a text file (e.g., student_ids.txt) containing 
multiple student IDs, one per line,in the format YYYY-N-MM-xxx (e.g., 2024-1-05-123).
3. Maintain a list of students who havenâ€™t been selected yet.
4. Randomly select a student for viva from the list.
5. Remove the selected student from the list.
6. Repeat steps 3 and 4 until all students have been picked.
7. When all students have been selected, reset the list to include all students 
again.

Additional Considerations: 
1. There should be error handling (e.g., for file not found).
2. The format of the output (e.g., add a "Viva #" counter) should be understandable
